# Privilege Escalation

## Introduction

- Gaining higher permission levels from the lower ones.

- Allows us to perform administrative tasks like :

    - Installing software
    - Modifying system settings
    - Accessing restricted files
    - Running administrative commands

- `hostname` : Returns the hostname of the target machine. Its value can be changed easily.

- `uname -a` : Prints system information giving additional details about the kernel.

- `/proc/version` : Information about processes in system.

- `/etc/issue` : More information about the system.

- `sudo -l` : The sudo -l command can be used to list all commands your user can run using sudo.

- `/etc/passwd` : Stores passwords.
